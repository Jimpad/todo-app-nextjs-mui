## Introduction

Todo application built to keep track of errands or tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list or create several lists each with unique tasks.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Database Included

I included the .env file containing the URI to my database for testing.

## NextJS with Cypress

```bash
# Start Cypress
npm run cypress
npm run cypress:headless

# Start E2E Tests
npm run e2e
npm run e2e:headless
```

## Deploy on Vercel

Application is deployed on vercel and can be found under the following [link](https://todo-app-jimpad.vercel.app/).
